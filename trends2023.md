## ML Trends in 2023
Machine learning and artificial intelligence is a field that drives major innovations across different industries. It is predicted that in 2023, the AI market will reach 500 billion, and in 2030, 1,597.1 billion in size. 

## Embedded Machine Learning or TinyML
Embedded machine learning is a growing trend in 2023 that opens up a whole new world of possibilities.
Embedded ML or TinyML works by integrating AI algorithms directly into devices and systems, making use of edge computing for real-time processing on the device itself.
How it works is: the machine learning system is trained on data beforehand, and then the trained model is embedded into the device or system. The device or system can then use the model to make predictions based on incoming data without having to send the data elsewhere for processing. This results in faster and more responsive AI, as the device can make predictions in real time.
Taking advantage of this benefits your machine learning programs by cutting down on latency and allowing them to produce better results. With the emergence of 5G technology, this trend is expected to become even more popular in 2023.
Be sure to explore embedded machine learning or TinyML if you’re looking for a way to improve your ML models this year! It could be the key to unlocking innovative applications that will bring you ahead of the competition.

## Low-Code and No-Code ML
Gone are the days when machine learning is handled and set up using computer code. Low-code and no-code platforms will become more popular this 2023!
Without extensive coding or technical expertise, this approach makes it easier for individuals to develop and implement ML models. These tools provide a graphical user interface (GUI) with pre-built components, such as algorithms, data preprocessing tools, and model evaluation metrics.
Prepare your machine learning projects this year because, with this approach, you can easily assemble components into a pipeline for their by dragging and dropping them onto a canvas and specifying their parameters.
However, low-code and no-code ML have limitations compared to traditional ML development, including limited customization options and lower-quality models. Nevertheless, it provides an accessible and convenient way to get started with ML!

Georgian Use Cases
Quick prototyping: Educate ourselves and our companies on how we can use these methods for quick prototyping! One example is AutoGluon from AWS. This is an AutoML package that works relatively well for normal use cases. 
 
## Foundation Models 
Large language models are an important innovation that has gained popularity recently and is most likely to stay with us in the nearest future. Foundation models are artificial intelligence tools that are trained on immense amounts of data, even compared to regular neural networks.
Engineers try to achieve a new level of understanding by teaching the machines to not just search for patterns but also accumulate knowledge. Foundation models are incredibly helpful in content generation and summarization, coding and translation, and customer support. Well-known examples of foundation models are GPT-3 and MidJourney.
An amazing thing about foundation models is that they can also scale fast and work with data they have never seen before, hence their wonderful generating capabilities. Leading providers of these solutions are NVIDIA and Open AI. 
Georgian Use Cases 
Foundation Models: We have to understand the best use cases for foudation models. When should we use them and when we should not! When should we aim to train foundation models from scratch and when we should just the existing off-the-shelf models. 

## Multimodal Machine Learning (MML)
In such tasks as computer vision or natural language processing that involve interaction between the model and the real world, the model often has to rely only on one type of data, be it images or text. But in real life, we perceive the world around us through many senses: smell, hearing, feeling textures, and flavors.
Multimodal machine learning suggests using the fact that the world around us can be experienced in multiple ways (called modalities) to build better models. The term “multimodal” in AI describes how to build ML models that can perceive the event in multiple modalities at a time, just like humans do.
Building an MML can be achieved through combining different types of information and using them in training. For example, matching images with audio and text labels to make them easier to recognize. Multimodal machine learning is so far a young field that is yet to be developed and advanced in 2023, but many believe that it can be key to achieving general AI.

## Machine Learning Operationalization Management (MLOps)
MLOPs are one of the emerging machine learning trends this year that will contribute greatly to businesses.
With the rise of ML and AI, it’s become clear that traditional development approaches may not be enough to fully take advantage of these technologies. That’s where MLOps comes in, offering a new approach that combines the development and deployment of ML systems into a streamlined and efficient process.
MLOps works to collect data and focus on management. With increasing amounts of data being generated, the need for automation is greater than ever. The systems life cycle, which is a cornerstone of the DevOps discipline, is also a critical component of MLOps. This helps organizations effectively manage the full lifecycle of their ML systems, from development to deployment and beyond.
This year, expect to see more organizations leveraging MLOps in their businesses as they look for effective ways of managing the development and deployment of their ML systems.
Georgian Use Cases 
MLOps work with portfolio companies: we are already strong here! 

## Responsible AI
The need for responsible artificial intelligence has become a crucial trend in the machine learning community in 2023. With advancements in AI and machine learning, the impact that these technologies can have on society is becoming increasingly apparent.
Organizations increasingly recognize the importance of ethical and transparent use of artificial intelligence technology. This is driven in part by growing concerns about privacy and data protection, as well as a desire to ensure that AI systems are aligned with human values.
One important development in this area is the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which gives Californians the right to know what data is being collected about them and to request that it be deleted. This and similar regulations are putting pressure on organizations to be more transparent and responsible in how they use AI, particularly when it comes to collecting, using, and storing consumer data.
As a result, Responsible AI is becoming an important factor in the development and deployment of ML systems and is likely to play a growing role in shaping the industry in the coming years.
This calls for need for organizations to ensure that their AI systems and related business processes are compliant with regulations and ethical standards. Organizations should also look at ways of creating accountable AI, such as incorporating ethical principles into system design and using analytics for anomaly detection.

## Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning is one of the hottest trends in the field of machine learning this 2023.
It’s a type of machine learning algorithm where an agent learns to make decisions by performing actions and receiving rewards or penalties based on the consequences of those actions. The goal is for the agent to maximize its total reward over time.
Reinforcement learning has a wide range of applications, from gaming and robotics to finance and healthcare, and it has been gaining significant attention in recent years due to its potential for solving complex problems in a more intuitive and efficient way than traditional machine learning methods.
With continued advancements in reinforcement learning algorithms and hardware, it is expected to become even more prevalent in the coming years.

## Transformers
Transformers are a type of artificial intelligence architecture that performs transduction (or transformation) on an input sequence of data using encoder and decoder and transforms it into another sequence. Many foundation models are also built on transformers. However, we wanted to point them out separately since they are used for many other applications. In fact, it is reported that transformers are taking the AI world by storm.
Also called Seq2Seq models, transformers are widely used in translation and other natural language processing tasks. Because transformers can analyze sequences of words rather than individual words, they generally show better results than ordinary artificial neural networks.
Rather than simply taking all words in a sentence and translating them word by word, a transformer model is able to assign weights that assess the importance to each word in the sequence. Then, the model transforms it into a sentence in a different language that takes in consideration the assigned weights. Some of the leading solutions that can help you build transformer pipelines are Hugging Face and Amazon Comprehend.

# GenAI for Vision

With the hype around LLMs, it might be easy to forget about everything happening with vision. We'll explore those developments here. 

Broadly speaking, there are two major categories of models to consider. The first is text-to-image models. These models do exactly that: convert text input into an image output. However, the use cases for these models are mostly limited to more creative fields. The second category is image-to-text. This includes use cases like visual question-answering and summarization. In this repository, we cover both categories. 

You can visit the `text-to-image.md` and `image-to-text.md` files respectively for more information. You can also find examples from both categories in the `examples` folder.

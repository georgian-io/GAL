<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
Each year, our AI team conducts an in-depth analysis of the most significant AI/ML trends, ensuring we remain at the forefront of innovation. By exploring blog posts, research papers, attending industry conferences, and participating in events, we stay well-informed and up-to-date.

Upon identifying these crucial trends, we prioritize and actively delve into each area, focusing on:

- Conducting comprehensive literature reviews
- Producing detailed technical briefings
- Creating introductory notebooks
- Applying our learnings to real-world use cases in our companies
- Transforming our knowledge into open-source, reusable assets and toolkits to benefit the broader community

To provide the best support for our customers, we also:

- Run benchmarks to evaluate the performance of new techniques
- Develop playbooks to guide users through the ever-evolving AI landscape

Get a glimpse of our work in this repo, where we share the fruits of our research and exploration, empowering you to harness the full potential of AI.
